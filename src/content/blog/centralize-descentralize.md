In a **centralised** network there is a central node that controls communication between all nodes.
A **decentralised** network is a series of interconnected hubs. If one hub goes down only the nodes connected to that hub will be affected, the rest of the network will still continue to function.
The internet is an example of a decentralised network. It is resilient against failure of several hubs.

If the central node in a _centralised_ network goes offline, all communication is disrupted.
In a decentralised network, one "hub" can be offline and the rest of the network can still communicate.

A ***distributed*** network is the most resilient type or ["topology"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology). In a distributed network any single node can completely fail and the remaining nodes will still be able to communicate.
