What role will we play in society?

The historical synergy between labor and capital has underpinned economic systems to date.

Labor has traditionally provided the cognitive and physical effort required for production, while capital has provided the tools, infrastructure, and financial resources needed to increase productivity.

However, the dizzying speed at which these tools are developing in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is upsetting this balance. As machines increasingly replicate or exceed human capabilities, critical questions arise: how can individuals maintain economic agency, and how can humanity ensure an equitable distribution of wealth in a production landscape dominated by intelligent systems? This is not some speculative theory, meant to shock. (VIDEO SHOWING SOLVING A CODING PROBLEM)

AI systems now compose legal briefs, generate music, and perform complex logistical tasks, often at significantly lower costs than human labor. As the marginal costs of intelligence and physical labor approach zero, the role of human labor in the global economy requires urgent rethinking. The Computational-Driven Economy David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage provides a valuable lens for understanding the disruptive potential of AI. Historically, nations have achieved economic dominance by specializing in sectors in which they held efficiency advantages. With AI, comparative advantage is shifting from traditional, labor-intensive sectors to those defined by access to advanced computing infrastructure and vast stores of data. Nations that can deploy AI systems to optimize productivity across all sectors are poised to dominate the global economy. Rapid advances in AI—enabled by exponential increases in computing power, more sophisticated algorithms, and unprecedented access to data—are fundamentally reshaping modern economies. While tangible assets such as factories and skilled labor were the backbone of economic power, today’s competitive advantage lies in the control of computing infrastructure and data flows. In previous industrial paradigms, cheap labor was the basis of competitive advantage. In the contemporary era, nations and companies derive their economic leadership from high-performance computing resources.

Tasks that once required extensive human involvement, such as data analysis or logistics planning, are now seamlessly performed by AI systems that operate with remarkable precision and consistency. The theory of costs and how AI accelerates economic transformation. AI will dramatically reduce these costs, enabling innovative business models that disrupt traditional organizational structures. For example, companies such as Uber and DoorDash use AI to optimize supply chains, reshaping entire industries. This highlights the dual role of AI as an enabler of efficiency and a potential arbiter of power, underscoring the social implications of centralizing such systems.

Reimagining Capital in an Age of Artificial Intelligence Marx’s theory of surplus value is particularly relevant to understanding the implications of AI-driven economies. In a post-labor economy, surplus value can be redistributed through mechanisms such as universal basic income or public ownership of AI infrastructure, ensuring that AI-driven productivity gains benefit society at large rather than exclusively in the hands of those who own the underlying assets. Historically, surplus value has arisen from human labor, with capitalists profiting from the disparity between labor productivity and its cost. AI introduces non-human agents as the primary drivers of productivity, shifting profits from surplus value to the ownership of algorithms, data sets, and computational systems. This fundamental shift heightens the urgency of addressing capital ownership to avoid worsening economic inequality. Conceptualizing capital as a product of “Ludwig Lachmann”
