# Western politicians with their blinkers.

## The Artificial Intelligence Revolution in Society

**AI** has the power to remake an entire **society** from scratch, the likes of which have not been seen since the [**renaissance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance). The Government, the Economy and National Security itself will be completely reformulated, reinvented and reformed.

It must be the United States, with its closest allies leading the way. The British Prime Minister (Stahmer) thinks he needs more AI startups in his country. Europe's leader (Von der Leyen) wants European companies to adopt AI faster as if it were a pill. And the American President himself (Joe Biden) thinks America is leading the way in AI. Everyone is losing focus. However, none of them seem to understand the essence of the issue.

## AI Leadership Lies in the Hands of Companies, Not Nations

It is not America and its allies who are leading! This is clear to me. In other words, it is not the United States of America as a democratic nation with individual rights and guarantees that protect its citizens. But yes, some companies registered in America that have the largest AI models (LLM) currently, the so-called cutting-edge models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Musk's GROK or Meta's Lama and others… . But these models are not the property of America. They are owned by very rich people (Billionaires), people who are developing systems in centralized networks, which within a few years (expected to reach AIG in 2029) will be smarter than everything and everyone on this planet called Earth.

The gross mistake these politicians make is to think of AI as a race for pure and simple profit, or for the prosperity of an unprepared society (ignorant in IT). That's too little. It's a race, yes! Who, by the way, left a long time ago, but not just for money but for pure and simple power. How are you doing in the 2025 election for the American presidency? Note the role of a Trump campaign financier. The almighty Mr. Musk. At the very least, it should raise some alarm in society. As would be expected.

## The Future: AGI and Transhuman Man

If Western society itself understood this new World. Where whoever gets to [**AGI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)(Artificial General Intelligence) first will rule over biological (Human) intelligence. Our children will be the last biological humans to walk the Earth. Let's watch the appearance of the [**Transhuman Man**](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism). And on this point, we agree, the entire information internet was designed (centralized), no matter where the company is registered, because they will have backups in other geographic locations to avoid forced nationalization. When governments realize that they no longer have control , will try(basic). But by then, it will be too late.

## The Mistake of Startups and the Power of Big Companies

All the small startups that the EU and UK are pouring millions of our dutifully collected taxes into have no chance of keeping up with the cutting-edge (LLM) models. We are already seeing this now as most small applications (SaaS) are being developed using these cutting-edge models. So all the money that Von der Leyen and Starmer and others… are handing out! This will only reinforce the power of cutting-edge LLM models. I don't mean to be dramatic! OK. There may be a company here or there with a different global strategy, but they will always be niche applications.

Why? Because it's **easier** (the great power of convenience), that means it's cheaper and easier to use in the long run. A good way to think of cutting-edge models (LLM) is to think of them as a new operating system ([**OS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)). Technically that's not what they are. But in practice this is how we will use them. To use the best (LLM) we will have to register with a [**KYC**](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Your_Customer)(Know Your Customer) so we can use them without restrictions. **tokens**](https://neptune.ai/blog/tokenization-in-nlp)(processes words into numbers through vectors/matrixes) to do everything on your devices which in turn are part of another centralized system like Apple's iOS and others…. We will use this AI to write emails, pay bills, organize our schedules and even deal with personal matters when we don't want to waste time responding. But since we don't want to be seen as insensitive arrogant people, we're going to put a custom [**Bot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bot) to filter and resolve. Let's procrastinate better than ever.

## AI: An Immediate Need

For governments and businesses, it will quickly become indispensable. If you do not register, you will not be able to compete. You will need to access financial management
